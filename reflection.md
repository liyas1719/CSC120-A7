Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

overloaded: moveIn and moveOut so that we could also take in a first and last name combination; sell coffee and cafe so that we could sell coffee with no add-ins and so that we could make a cafe with options of mugs "for here"; checkOut and returnBook so that we can keep trakc of libaray card holders should they care to use their library card

i am still confiused on how to display my overloaded components but i am glad that i sat down and contructed it all in one go, there are a lot of moving parts and it was easier not having to relearn all of the variables and whatnot when i returned to the project
